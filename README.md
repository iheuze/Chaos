# Chaos
Python script for simulating and visualizing the behavior of a chaotic system known as the Lorenz system. The Lorenz system is a set of three ordinary differential equations that describe the evolution of a dynamical system with three variables (x, y, and z). The system is known for its chaotic behavior, which means it is highly sensitive to initial conditions.
